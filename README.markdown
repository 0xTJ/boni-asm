Boni is an easily retargetable assembler
========================================

It should take a few hours to add support for new architectures. You just have to edit architecture.py

I wrote it for one of my courses so I had to finish it pretty quickly. It is well written though.

I hope someone can build from this.

Usage:
> python assembler.py yourfile.s
> python assembler.py examples/example1.s

Options:
* -o some_file                        Output the compiled code to some_file
* -b                                  Output in binary
