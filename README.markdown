Boni is an easily retargetable assembler
========================================

It should take a few hours to add support for new architectures. You just have to edit [architecture.py](/ynd/boni-asm/tree/master/architecture.py "architecture.py").


I wrote it for one of my courses so I had to finish it pretty quickly. It is well written though(Pythonic).

It only supports one architecture for now. A general purpose micro-processor made in our course. I am confident it can support x86 with minimal effort.

I hope someone can build from this.

Usage:

`python assembler.py yourfile.s

python assembler.py examples/example1.s`

Options:

`-b                                  Output in binary`
